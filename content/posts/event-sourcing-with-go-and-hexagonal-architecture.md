Not long ago I have slowly started preparing material for a pragmatic hands-on book I’ve always wanted to write on the topic of event sourcing, where I would explore it in my own approachable way, applicable to any skill level while also spicing it up with golang, ports and adapters, tdd, testing, event driven architecture and good software engineering practices in general.

It’s still early days and I am still fleshing it out. I would be grateful if anyone that is interested in any of these topics would reach out to me with any suggestions regarding specific topics you would like covered etc…

Thanks for reading.
