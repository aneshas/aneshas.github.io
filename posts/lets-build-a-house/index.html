That inevitably reminds us of buildings and construction. While this may be true up to some extent, there are a lot of discrepancies between the approaches we take towards architecting a building (a house for example) and a typical web application software system. Much more so if we employ agile practices while doing so (which I hope we all do).\nSoftware architecture is more about defining and formalizing constraints and gathering quality attributes that we need to satisfy while implementing business requirements.\nA good architect tries to defer most of the architectural decisions that don’t affect the most important quality attributes directly. These decisions can then be made downstream by the developers in charge of building the actual solution (the architect himself should be one of them). This indeed means that software architecture “is not” about making “all” of the decisions upfront, but rather, only the important ones.\nLet’s look at a simple example. Let us contrast building a house in the real world versus building a virtual house (a hypothetical software system, might be a simple web application).\nSome things of concern, but not limited to might be:\nLand (Infrastructure) Floor plans (Architecture / technical diagrams) Foundations (Initial project setup) Floors and the roof, walls, bulkheads, etc… (Software Layers) Functional rooms + furniture (Actual features that bring value) So how do these compare?\nLand (Infrastructure) When building a house we need to purchase (allocate) the entire piece of land that our house will sit on top of. Plus, we need to account for some more if we maybe decide to make some extensions to our hose (a garage maybe, a garden …).\nThis implies that most of the time we need to know the size of the land needed upfront which in turn implies that we are required to make a large upfront cost in order to purchase the land even before we even start with the actual construction.\nIn contrast, when building a software system the agile way, we try to avoid these upfront commitments. Why? Because we can!\nWhy is this the case?\nAsk yourself, what is software? If you think hard enough, you will come to the conclusion that software, in essence, is just a pile of text, compiled to machine language (instructions) in order to be executed to (hopefully) perform some useful work for us people.\nAnd what is the nature of “text”. Well, most importantly, text can be changed, expanded, erased, reorganized, burned and thrown away. It’s subject to change.\nIf you think otherwise, you are living a lie and becoming aware of this asap will do you much, much good.\nBut even if you choose not to be aware of this, I can tell you one thing for sure: The clients are!\nSo, going back to our example, how much land (infrastructure) do we allocate for our software system? The answer is, as little as possible, or to put it differently, only as much as we need to.\nStaying agile is all about iterations, tight feedback loops and building as little as needed when we need it.\nWe try to avoid making big upfront commitments and incurring costs that are uncalled for. As a side note, if you’ve ever wondered what cloud computing is all about, now you know (pay only for what you use)…\nFor the software system in our example (our virtual house), we would allocate/purchase only enough resources we need for our first iteration, feature or sprint. Nothing more, nothing less, because unlike with land, we can always but more.\nFloor plans When building a house in the real world, in 99% of the cases we have the whole plan ready upfront. We hire an architect, decide on almost all features (rooms, layout), materials, etc and again, we make another upfront payment and only now we can start building foundations for our house.\nAfter this point, pretty much every decision is immutable, and any change to the initial plan is hard to make or would surely incur a lot of extra unplanned cost because once concrete hardens it’s really tough to break. That’s just the nature of it.\nWe take this for granted because we understand the reasoning behind it and have learned to live it.\nBut surprisingly this isn’t true for software. Many people still compare building software with building houses, and this cannot be further than the truth.\nAs we said, software is different. A good architect does not make all of the decisions up front. Why? Because software is easy to change (and will change, it’s just text) so we don’t want to limit our legroom that we will most surely need later.\nMost importantly, we don’t want to spend any more money than necessary. Will we like that bedroom on the second floor? Will we even need it?!\nEverything else After we have the foundations are laid down, it’s time to start building our floors.\nFloor by floor, layer by layer, weeks and months pass while we wait with our fingers crossed and hope for the best.\nFinally, when the house is done, final work can begin and only then can we start throwing in the furniture.\nA few months later, we finally get to use our house.\nI think you can see the pattern by now.\nArchitecture deals with horizontal slices. Floor by floor, layer by layer, because it’s easier to do it this way (and it’s cost-effective).\nBut when building software systems, we deal with vertical slices (or should). What does this mean?\nWhen creating software solutions, we start from the most important thing (the core), build all the vertical slices for it, and then work our way out (horizontally) by adding new features to the core or improving the core itself.\nIn our virtual house example, this could be anything really, but let’s take a bedroom as an example.\nLet’s pretend that we sat with the customer and decided that having a place to sleep in asap would be of the highest priority.\nThus, our main goal should be to deliver a single useful feature for our customer which can be tested out and for which we can get constructive feedback at the earliest moment possible.\nI hope you can understand why this can be useful (in contrast to waiting for months for first feedback)\nSo, some of our basic goals are:\nTo make as small number of set in stone decisions as possible Avoid the unnecessary upfront cost Have something ready as soon as possible (Something useful) Get feedback from the customer at the earliest possible moment How would we go about doing this? We do the simplest thing. We simply follow the path of the least resistance. In analogy to the real house, building our virtual house might follow steps similar to these:\nWe allocate just enough “land” for a single bed. Build just enough of foundation that can accommodate our bed + some walking space around it Next, the bed comes in We put up a cheap set of walls (non-concrete ones) At last, we cover our small bedroom with a makeshift roof, just enough to keep the rain out. And… we are done. We are now ready to call in our client and receive some constructive feedback about it. Hell, he could even spend the night.\nOnce we have our feedback, the client decides what is the next most important thing for him…\nIt might be to thicken the walls and make them production-grade. Maybe it will snow soon, and we should put up a more serious roof. Perhaps he wants to experiment with the interior decoration of the room. Or maybe this is just what he needs, it will be enough to sleep in for some time, and now he would like us to add a toilet adjacent to our bedroom. This way we ensure that the customer always gets what he wants, and not what he asked for! — Remember what we said about the nature of software! Customers have a nose for this and they will always want something other than what they initially specified.\nSo in a nutshell:\nYou start from the core, do as little as possible, but usable. Gather feedback, decide on what’s next. Rinse and repeat! Final words If you take away anything, let it be this:\nBuilding software is nothing like building a single house/building.\nBuilding software is much more involved than this. To build, evolve and maintain a software system is more similar to city planning than to building a single house. (Let’s face it, it’s never a single house anyway).\nCities like software, have lives of their own. Cities evolve, grow (or even shrink) in size. New buildings are added (features) all the time, old ones are refurbished or demolished(refactoring).\nNew water and heating lines are added, removed and replaced on a daily basis. Metro lines are bored under the city.\nWhile doing all of this, you can never shut down a city. You can close down some parts of it but as a whole, it must always remain functional.\nThis is why building software is neither simple nor easy, but only by embracing change, and failure (this might be a topic for another blog post) we can be prepared, and triumph!\n","wordCount":"1556","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://anes.io/posts/city.jpeg","datePublished":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-02-04T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://anes.io/posts/lets-build-a-house/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Anes Hasicic","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://anes.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://anes.io/ accesskey=h title="Anes Hasicic (Alt + H)">Anes Hasicic</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://anes.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://anes.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Let’s build a house</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2020-02-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 4, 2020</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;8 min</div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=lazy src=https://anes.io/posts/city.jpeg alt></figure><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#land-infrastructure aria-label="Land (Infrastructure)">Land (Infrastructure)</a></li><li><a href=#floor-plans aria-label="Floor plans">Floor plans</a></li><li><a href=#everything-else aria-label="Everything else">Everything else</a></li><li><a href=#final-words aria-label="Final words">Final words</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>When talking about software, we often hear the term “architecture” mentioned a lot.
