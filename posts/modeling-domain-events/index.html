For example:\nUserCreated ProductUpdated ProductStatusChanged Let’s take UserCreated as an example. From a domain perspective, if you really take your time and think about it, can a user ever actually be created? What does that even mean? How was the user created? Why? What caused this to happen? Is that what really happened?\nMore often than not, this is a design smell and InsertYourNounHereCreated rarely reflects a domain concept and does not tell us much about what happened.

UserCreated was at least specific to a point that we could deduct to a certain degree of certainty that a new user entity spurred into existence and that it was somehow created in our system. On the other hand, ProductUpdated only says that a product is now somehow different than it was before, nothing more. To what extent? Why? What does this imply about the state of the product? We can’t really know.\nIt’s more likely that one of these things might have happened:\nProductDiscontinued ProductPriceChanged (or even ProductPriceIncreased but this is the case where we can get too granular introducing additional accidental complexity without gaining little to no value) ProductWentOutOfStock If UserCreated and ProductUpdated reminded you of CRUD, you were right. Moving away from CRUD requires a “change of mindset”, not just introducing new modeling tools and focusing on what the system does instead on what the system is.\nBe as explicit and fine-grained as possible. You can get away with being less explicit and more coarse-grained if not using Event Sourcing for example — but if you are, you have no excuse and you probably missed the whole point of event sourcing if your domain events convey no meaning.\nName them by the outcome that was intended (happy path) or by the reason the use case couldn’t have been executed (sad path).\nWhat information should our Domain Events contain? Event name should imply meaning without the need to look into its contents (eg. ItemActivated). Reaching for its contents should only provide us with the actual details that describe the fact that we want to model.\nIn the case of SensorActivated event, there is no need to include properties such as newStatusName, oldStatus, newStatus or status — this is implicit due to the explicit naming convention of our event.\nDon’t put the same data in different forms eg. an Enum underlying value and ToString variant, only use serialized values, descriptions can be found elsewhere eg. in schema descriptions…\nUse primitive types and make your value objects able to serialize or deserialize to/from those types (encode / decode) by different systems other than your own (you don’t know who the consumer might be).\nFinal words Domain events, when read in sequence (eg from our event store, outbox queue, etc…) should tell a narrative about a certain use case/workflow that occurred in the domain that we are trying to model.\nFor example: “When executing a Place Order use case, given the current state of the Order Aggregate, the command succeeded and the Order was placed, followed by it being Canceled…” which is hard to accomplish with CRUD-like events.\n","wordCount":"740","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-03-05T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-03-05T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://anes.io/posts/modeling-domain-events/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Anes Hasicic","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://anes.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://anes.io/ accesskey=h title="Anes Hasicic (Alt + H)">Anes Hasicic</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://anes.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://anes.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Modeling Domain Events</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-03-05 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>March 5, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#naming-domain-events aria-label="Naming Domain Events">Naming Domain Events</a></li><li><a href=#what-information-should-our-domain-events-contain aria-label="What information should our Domain Events contain?">What information should our Domain Events contain?</a></li><li><a href=#final-words aria-label="Final words">Final words</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Domain Event is a powerful modeling tool.
